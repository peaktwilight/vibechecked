> Paste a URL. Get roasted. Find out if your UI is actually good or just another vibe-coded clone.

## What is this?

Vibecheck screenshots any website, sends it to Claude for brutal design analysis, and scores it across 5 dimensions. It detects 11 red flags of vibe-coded UIs — the purple gradients, the glassmorphism cards, the "Hero -> Features -> Pricing -> Footer" layout that every AI-generated landing page has. You get a roast, a verdict, and a shareable scorecard PNG.

**Features:**

- **5 scoring dimensions** — Originality, Layout, Typography, Color, Overall
- **11 red flags** detected (purple gradients, glassmorphism, generic SaaS patterns...)
- **`--compare url1 url2`** — head-to-head comparison mode
- **`--json`** — machine-readable JSON output
- **Shareable PNG scorecard** — 1200x630, Twitter/OG-optimized, saved automatically

## Quick Start

```bash
npx vibechecked https://your-site.com
```

## Usage

```bash
# Single site
npx vibechecked https://my-app.vercel.app

# Compare two sites head-to-head
npx vibechecked --compare vercel.com linear.app

# JSON output (pipe it, parse it, automate it)
npx vibechecked --json https://example.com
```

## Compare mode

Pit two sites against each other. Vibecheck analyzes both in parallel and declares a winner.

```bash
npx vibechecked --compare vercel.com linear.app
```

Example output:

```
  VIBECHECK  —  head to head

  vercel.com              vs    linear.app
  72/100                        85/100

  Originality  72 ████████    vs   85 ██████████
  Layout       68 ████████    vs   80 █████████
  Typography   75 █████████   vs   88 ██████████
  Color        70 ████████    vs   82 █████████

  MOSTLY FRESH                    CERTIFIED ORIGINAL

  WINNER: linear.app 🏆
```

## JSON output

Get structured data for scripts, dashboards, or CI pipelines.

```bash
npx vibechecked --json https://example.com
```

Returns the full analysis as JSON — scores, roast, red flags, verdict, and vibe-coded probability.

## What it scores

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Originality** | Human-designed or AI-generated aesthetic? |
| **Layout** | Creative composition or the same template everyone ships? |
| **Typography** | Intentional type choices or default Inter with random weights? |
| **Color** | Real palette or purple gradient + white cards? |
| **Overall** | Weighted average (originality counts 2x) |

Plus a **vibe-coded probability** meter — how likely someone prompted this into existence.

## Red flags it detects

1. Purple/blue gradients on hero sections
2. Glassmorphism cards with blur backgrounds
3. "Hero -> Features -> Testimonials -> Pricing -> Footer" layout
4. Generic stock illustrations or 3D blob shapes
5. "Get Started" / "Start Free Trial" buttons that look identical to every SaaS
6. Excessive rounded corners on everything
7. Dark mode with neon accents (the "developer tool" starter pack)
8. Grid of 3 feature cards with icons
9. Floating mockup screenshots at an angle
10. "Trusted by" logo bars
11. Gradient text on headings

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CERTIFIED ORIGINAL** | Actually designed by a human with taste |
| **MOSTLY FRESH** | Some original thinking happened here |
| **KINDA MID** | It's fine. It's all fine. |
| **GENERIC AF** | You've seen this site before. Many times. |
| **VIBE-CODED CLONE** | This was prompted into existence at 2am |

## Shareable Scorecard

Vibecheck generates a 1200x630 PNG scorecard (Twitter/OG image optimized) you can post when you want to publicly shame your competitor's landing page. Saved to `./vibecheck-{domain}.png`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`) — used for vision analysis
- Playwright Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`)

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peaktwilight/vibechecked
cd vibecheck
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
node dist/cli.js https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## How it works

1. Captures a 1440x900 @2x screenshot with Playwright (waits for network idle + animations)
2. Sends it to Claude for vision-based design analysis
3. Gets scores, a roast, red flags, and a verdict
4. Prints a color-coded terminal scorecard + saves a shareable PNG
